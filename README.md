# Rgoodpractice

As nicely written by Hadley Wickham R guru, "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread." 
    In 6th session of the R User Group in Grenoble, we will review good practice to write 1) R code and 2) R packages. 
    In a first part, we will present some ideas of the tidyverse style guide (following http://style.tidyverse.org/) including the styler package (interactively restyle selected text) and the lintr package (automated style checks).
    The second part will be devoted to writing R packages, which is at the basis of reproducibility. We will learn how to use the Roxygen package to (quite automatically) turn personal code into reusable code (following http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).
    Make sure you have the latest versions of RStudio, styler, lintr, and Roxygen packages installed.
