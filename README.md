# Good practice for writing R code and R packages

As nicely written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) R guru,  

> "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread." 

In this 6th session of the [R User Group in Grenoble](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/index.html), we will review good practice to write 

1. R code and 
2. R packages.  

In a first part, we will present some ideas of the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) including the [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/) package (interactively restyle selected text) and the [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package (automated style checks).  
    The second part will be devoted to writing [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), which is at the basis of reproducibility. We will learn how to use the [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) package to (quite automatically) turn personal code into reusable code.  
    Make sure you have the latest versions of RStudio, styler, lintr, and Roxygen packages installed.
